It is created for the sake of easiness of user usage and the better handling of resource usage. It uses some of the **cmd plugins** for fulfilling the purpose. I’ve created two versions of this application. As both versions use **fn.dll** for getting input – but 1st version uses the gotoxy **batch plugin**, while 2nd version uses colous plugin.

The reason why, I've used colous in 2nd version is the response time. As the response time of **'gotoxy'** much longer than **'colous'** Plugin.
